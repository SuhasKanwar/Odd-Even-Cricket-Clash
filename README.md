# Odd-Even Cricket Clash

Odd-Even Cricket Clash is a console-based cricket game written in C++. It features a classic odd-even toss mechanism to decide who bats or bowls first and allows players to compete against a computer opponent.

## Features

Odd-Even Toss: Choose odd or even to determine the toss winner.

Batting and Bowling: Alternate between batting and bowling with randomly generated scores.

Replayability: Option to play multiple rounds with choices to restart or exit.


## How to Play

Start the Game: Choose whether to play the odd/even game.

Toss: Select your toss choice (odd or even). Winning the toss lets you decide to bat or bowl first. Losing the toss means the computer decides.

Gameplay: Bat and bowl in turns, aiming to score more runs than the computer opponent.

Win or Lose: The player with the most runs wins the game. If scores are equal, the game is a draw.
